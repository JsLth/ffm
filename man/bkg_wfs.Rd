\usage{
bkg_wfs(
  type_name,
  endpoint = type_name,
  version = "2.0.0",
  method = NULL,
  format = "application/json",
  layer = NULL,
  epsg = 3035,
  properties = NULL,
  filter = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type_name}{Feature type of the WFS to retrieve.}

\item{endpoint}{Endpoint to interface. Note that \code{wfs_} is appended
and only the rest of the product name must be provided. For example,
\code{wfs_vg250} becomes \code{vg250}. Defaults to the value of
\code{type_name}.}

\item{version}{Service version of the WFS. Usually 2.0.0, but some services
still use 1.0.0 or 1.1.0.}

\item{method}{HTTP method to use for the request. \code{GET} requests
provide parameters using URL queries. Filters must be provided as CQL
queries. While this is less error-prone, it allows a maximum number of
only 2048 characters. Especially when providing more sophisticated spatial
queries, \code{GET} queries are simply not accepted by the services. In
these cases it makes sense to use \code{POST} requests instead.

If \code{NULL}, the method is inferred from the type of filter query
provided to \code{filter} (either XML or CQL). If no filter is provided,
the method is inferred from \code{getOption("ffm_query_language")}.}

\item{format}{Content type of the output. This value heavily depends
the endpoint queried. Most services allow \code{application/json} but some
only support GML outputs. When in doubt, inspect the \code{GetCapabilities}
of the target service. Defaults to \code{"application/json"}.}

\item{layer}{If \code{format} specifies a GML output, \code{layer}
specifies which layer from the downloaded GML file to read. Only necessary
if the GML file actually contains multiple layers. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{epsg}{Numeric value giving the EPSG identifier of the coordinate
reference system (CRS). The EPSG code is automatically formatted in a
OGC-compliant manner. Note that not all EPSG codes are supported. Inspect
the \code{GetCapabilities} of the target service to find out which
EPSG codes are available. Defaults to EPSG:3035.}

\item{properties}{Names of columns to include in the output. Defaults to
\code{NULL} (all columns).}

\item{filter}{A WFS filter query (CQL or XML) created by
\code{\link{wfs_filter}}.}

\item{...}{Further parameters passed to the WFS query. Ignored for
\code{POST} requests.}

\description{
Low-level interface to BKG-style web feature services (WFS). This function
is used in all high-level functions of \code{ffm}, e.g.,
\code{\link{bkg_admin}}.
